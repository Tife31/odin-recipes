    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 1/2 pound tomahawk rib eye steak</li>
        <li> 1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>     
        <li> 2 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Remove steak from refrigerator and let 
            stand at room temperature 30 minutes to an hour before cooking.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the grill to medium-high, 400 to 450 degrees F (200 to 230 degrees C). Sprinkle steak 
            evenly and liberally on all sides with salt and black pepper. 
        </li>
        <li>Lightly coat grill grates with oil or grilling spray. 
            Place steak on hot grates, and grill, undisturbed, until it 
            releases easily from the grates, about 4 minutes. 
            Flip, and repeat on the other side. Continue grilling, 
            turning occasionally, until a thermometer inserted into the 
            thickest portion of steak registers 125 degrees F (52 degrees C), 30 to 40 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer steak to a cutting board; let rest 15 minutes. 
            Run a knife along the inside edge of the bone to remove 
            steak from the bone in 1 piece; slice against the grain to 
            serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
